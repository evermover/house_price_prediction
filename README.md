# house_price_prediction
This is my first project. I used Linear regression, Lasso and Decision Tree for project. Linear regression gave the best result.
In this project I get the dataset from  Kaggle and perform the data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis and then I go for making 
the model to predict the house prices.
