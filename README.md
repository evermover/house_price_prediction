## Introduction
Predicting house prices is a crucial task in the real estate market. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict house prices in Bangalore, India. We've utilized a combination of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model selection to build an accurate predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle. It consists of various features related to houses in Bangalore and their corresponding prices. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure the accuracy of our predictions.

## Data Cleaning
Before conducting any analysis or modeling, we carefully cleaned the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data. This step ensures the quality and reliability of our predictions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is a crucial step to understand the characteristics of the dataset. We performed visualizations and statistical analyses to uncover insights about the relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices). This helped us make informed decisions during model selection.

## Model Selection
After EDA, we experimented with different regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression. Based on the results, Linear Regression showed the best performance, achieving the desired balance between accuracy and interpretability.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize the performance of our Linear Regression model, we employed GridSearch CV to fine-tune hyperparameters. This process helps in finding the best combination of hyperparameters that maximizes the model's predictive power.

## Model Deployment
The final trained Linear Regression model has been saved and is provided in this repository. This model can be used to predict house prices in Bangalore based on input features.

## Usage
To use the trained model for predicting house prices, you can refer to the provided Jupyter notebook. The notebook guides you through loading the model and making predictions on new data.
